# ImageBorderiser
Adds a border to an image (but technically creates a canvas and adds the image on top)

*This was intended for Chromebooks with Crostini installed but editing code is a thing.*

# Crostini Setup:

- Set the screenshots directory to a folder called "Screenshots"
- Run the main.py file
